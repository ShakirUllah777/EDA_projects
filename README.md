# 🚢 Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This is a **basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project** built using the famous **Titanic dataset**.
The project is designed for **Machine Learning students** who have learned **Python basics** and core data analysis libraries such as **NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step before applying Machine Learning models.
In this project, we explore the Titanic dataset to:

* Understand the structure of the data
* Identify missing values
* Analyze relationships between features
* Gain insights that help in model building

This project focuses **only on data analysis and visualization**, not prediction.
